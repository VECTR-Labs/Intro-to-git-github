# ioc_allowlist.txt (Conflict Practice)
#
# This file exists ONLY to manufacture a predictable merge conflict during training.
# Real teams often maintain shared allowlists/denylists and conflicts happen naturally.
#
# Lab rule:
#   Edit ONLY the line under "CONFLICT_ZONE" when instructed.

# Baseline allowlist entries (examples)
microsoft.com
okta.com
github.com

# CONFLICT_ZONE (edit the next line only)
example.com
testing.com

# End of file
